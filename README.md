# Hasans Weather Dashboard

This is my weather dashboard. It is created in JavaScript. It will run in the browser and feauture dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I have manipulated the free Weather API to show the current and future Weather conditions in any given city. Once searched, the webpage will show the current weather conditions - including the Temperature (Celsius), Condition, Humidity (%) and the Wind Speed (km/h) in that given city. As well as a 5-day forecast in that city - showing the Average Temperature (Celsius) for each day, Condition, Average Humidity (%) and the Maximum Wind Speed (km/h). This webpage also uses local storage and will show the previously searches cities on the page. When the page is refreshed, the previous searches remain on the page. The previous searches are buttons, so once they're clicked, the forecast for the selected city will be shown.

## Acceptance Criteria

The weather dashboard meets the following acceptance criteria:
